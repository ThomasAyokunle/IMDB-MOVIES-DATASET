Data Cleaning Project
This project focuses on a data cleaning task performed on a dataset available in the following Google Drive folder:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1akZcttUgyiDYRtoKAACvsS5TnMhLCNRH?direction=a.

Project Overview
The objective of this project is to demonstrate the process of cleaning and preparing the dataset for further analysis. 
The dataset contains comprehensive information on IMDB movies. the data includes attributes such as original title, release year, country, genre, director. Additional details like duration, score, income and votes are also included
The cleaning process aims to address various data quality issues, such as missing values, inconsistencies, outliers, and formatting problems.

Files Included
messy_data.csv: The original dataset file.
cleaned_copy.csv: The cleaned version of the dataset.
cleaned(dirty data).ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing the code and steps followed for the data cleaning process.

Getting Started
To replicate or explore this data cleaning project, follow the steps below:

Download the dataset: Access the Google Drive folder https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1akZcttUgyiDYRtoKAACvsS5TnMhLCNRH?direction=a and download the messy_data.csv file

Install dependencies: Make sure you have Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries mentioned in the cleaned(dirty data).ipynb file. You can use the following command to install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the code: Open the cleaned(dirty data).ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment. Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the notebook to understand the cleaning process and apply it to the dataset.

Review the cleaned dataset: Once the cleaning process is complete, you can find the cleaned dataset named cleaned_copy.csv. This file contains the dataset with the applied transformations and cleaned data ready for further analysis.

Results
The data cleaning process resulted in a cleaned dataset that is now free of inconsistencies and data quality issues. The cleaned dataset is suitable for various analysis, modeling, and visualization tasks. By following the code and instructions in the notebook, you will be able to replicate the cleaning process and obtain similar results.
